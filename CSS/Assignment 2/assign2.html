        <h3>Lyrics</h3>
        <div class="intro">
            <p>Yeah</p>
            <p>I know sometimes</p>
            <p>Things may not always make sense to you right now</p>
            <p>But hey</p>
            <p>What <span class="name">Daddy</span> always tell you?</p>
            <p><span class="command">Straighten up</span>, little soldier</p>
            <p><span class="command">Stiffen up</span> that upper lip</p>
            <p>What you <span class="sad">cryin'</span> about?</p>
            <p>You got me</p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse1">
            <p><span class="name"> Hailie</span>, I know you miss your<span class="name"> Mom</span>, and I know you miss your<span> Dad</span></p>
            <p>When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had</p>
            <p>I can see you're <span class="sad">sad</span>, even when you <span class="happy">smile</span>, even when you<span> laugh</span></p>
            <p>I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry</p>
            <p>'Cause you're <span class="fear">scared</span>, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers</p>
            <p>No more <span class="sad" >cryin'</span>, wipe them <span class="sad">tears</span>, Daddy's here, no more nightmares</p>
            <p>We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it</p>
            <p>Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it</p>
            <p>We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls</p>
            <p>When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls</p>
            <p><span class="confused">Lookin' puzzled</span>, in a <span class="confused"> daze</span>, I know it's confusin' you</p>
            <p>Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news</p>
            <p>I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems</p>
            <p>The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me</p>
            <p>All the things growin' up as <span class="name">Daddy</span> that he had to see</p>
            <p>Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did</p>
            <p>We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me</p>
            <p>But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'</p>
            <p>Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers</p>
            <p>But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason</p>
            <p>I guess it was never meant to be</p>
            <p>But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what <span class="fantasy">destiny</span> is</p>
            <p>But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep</p>
            <p>Maybe one day we'll<span class="command"> wake up</span> and this'll all just be a <span class="fantasy">dream</span></p>

        </div>
        <div class="chorus">
            <p>Now hush, little baby, don't you <span class="sad">cry</span></p>
            <p>Everything's gonna be alright</p>
            <p>Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya</p>
            <p>Daddy's here to hold ya <span class="fantasy">through the night</span></p>
            <p>I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why</p>
            <p>We feel how we feel inside</p>
            <p>It may seem a <span class="happy"> little crazy</span>, pretty baby</p>
            <p>But I promise Mama's gon' be alright</p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse2">
            <p>Heh, it's funny</p>
            <p>I remember back one year when <span class="money">Daddy had no money</span></p>
            <p>Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree</p>
            <p>And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em</p>
            <p>I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night <span class="sad">crying</span></p>
            <p>'Cause Daddy felt like a bumâ€”see, Daddy had a job</p>
            <p>But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom</p>
            <p>And at the time, every house that we lived in</p>
            <p>Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block</p>
            <p>And your Mom was savin' <span class="money"> money</span> for you in a jar</p>
            <p>Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college</p>
            <p>Almost had a <span class="money">thousand dollars</span>, 'til someone broke in and stole it</p>
            <p>And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart</p>
            <p>And it seemed like everything was just startin' to<span> fall apart</span></p>
            <p><span class="sad">Mom and Dad was arguin'</span> a lot</p>
            <p>So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment</p>
            <p>And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara</p>
            <p>And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD</p>
            <p>And met <span class="name">Dr. Dre</span> , and flew you and Mama out to see me</p>
            <p>But Daddy had to work, <span class="sad">you and Mama had to leave me</span></p>
            <p>Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV</p>
            <p>And Mama didn't like it</p>
            <p>And you and Lainie were too young to understand it</p>
            <p>Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit</p>
            <p>And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it</p>
            <p>I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand</p>
            <p>'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud</p>
            <p>Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'</p>
            <p>Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just<span class="fantasy"> trips me out</span></p>
            <p>To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now</p>
            <p>Wow, guess you pretty much are, and <span class="fantasy">Daddy's still here</span></p>
            <p>Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, <span class="fantasy">Daddy's still here</span></p>
            <p>I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?</p>
            <p>Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment</p>

        <div class="chorus2">
            <p>And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a <span class="fantasy">mockingbird</span></p>
            <p>I'ma give you the <span class="fantasy">world</span></p>
            <p>I'ma buy a <span class="money">diamond ring</span> for you, I'ma sing for you</p>
            <p>I'll do anything for you to see you <span class="happy"> smile</span></p>
            <p>And if that <span class="fantasy"> mockingbird</span> don't sing and that ring don't shine</p>
            <p>I'ma break that birdie's neck</p>
            <p>I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya</p>
            <p>And make him eat every carat, don't <span class="anger">fuck</span><span class="name"> with Dad!</span> <span class="happy">(Haha)</span></p>
